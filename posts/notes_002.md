The question of how 'political' to be ...

It's commonly said of neoliberalism that it attempts to 'remove politics' from governance and economics.  Long history, there; and the original neoliberal theorists were many of them responding to the horrors they'd witnessed in their time that were perpetrated by authoritarian-right and -left political movements.  The dream was therefore to develop a set of invisible, agnostic, 'fair' rules that everyone would be governed by -- a global economic system -- within which people could arrange their affairs.  By making this about economics transactions and the 'free market', it was felt that this would avoid the worst aspects of politics.  

Now, many on the left see this project as at best naive, and at worst a sort of nefarious, invisible power grab that simultaneous concentrates political power in the hands of a few while brainwashing everyone else into thinking that they 'deserve what they get, because it was freely chosen / is what they deserve.

So, there's a push on the left to resurface this submerged politics; to question the technocratic, 'apolitical' stance adopted by mainstream politicians today; in short, to bring political critique and perspective back into everyday affairs.

It is therefore interesting now to read the reflections of organizers in the 60s who, while in position of a very clear and urgent political agenda, were wondering how 'political' to be in their 'propaganda efforts'.  Anarchists whose aim was a fundamental transformation of how we live, work, and interact were often telling one another that their best hope for achieving their goals was, in fact, to avoid talk of 'politics' with people on the street, and simply to start enacting the structures they wanted to see built -- alternative schools, alternative housing, urban gardens, small workshops.  

How to reconcile all of this?
