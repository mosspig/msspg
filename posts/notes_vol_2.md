## Murray Bookchin

Essay on [Ecological Crisis](http://new-compass.net/articles/ecological-crisis-socialism-and-new-society):

The primary implication of this most basic message is a call for a politics and even an economics that offer a democratic alternative to the nation-state and the market society.
