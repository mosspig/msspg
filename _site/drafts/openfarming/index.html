<p>what is the motivation for centralize / decentralize? it's power.
review The Dig on common wealth -- the language -- it's about power, agency, governance.</p>
<p>decentralization is also: anti-monopoly</p>
<p>but it's the logic of capitalism to lead to monopoly</p>
<p>incentivizing work based on getting rewarded for what you've contributed is perhaps the fundamental flaw</p>
<p>'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'</p>
<p>how do people do it in math? in physics? etc?</p>
<p>'open farming is not the mediator' -- but, they manage the protocol -- so ....</p>
<p>what's the motivation for open farming?</p>
<p>interesting overlap: blockchain royalites and carbon credits ...</p>
<p>is it better to engage and critique, or simply ignore and move on?</p>
<p>'puts a legal barrier on free riders'</p>
<p>18:00</p>
<p>honeycomb:</p>
<p>so: how do we track meaningful tweaks to design?  what counts as a difference, who gets royalties?</p>
<p>invocation of cooperatives</p>
<p>this is all a fantasy around how the data is useful or not, even on its own terms
and who would pay
at what level</p>
<p>i.e. if the incentives are at all important, then the <em>amounts</em> that we're talking about -- how much profit people get out of these systems -- is important.  if we can never imagine the data paying enough to be meaningful, then it's a non-starter -- even within the logic of capitalism.</p>
<p>22:00</p>
<p>'if farmer attempts to cheat the system, information services are disconnected
without the services, farmer becomes less and less competitive</p>
<p>so -- algoritmic punishment for not following the rules</p>
<p>once thought:  isn't blockchain typically sneaking IP in the back door?  licensing <em>assumes</em> IP -- otherwise why a license?</p>
<p>25:00 -- quadrant ignores: most of human history, socialism, many many projects, tax-funded projects -- new deal</p>
<p>27:00 -- 'agriculture is pretty well decentralized at the moment' -- ???</p>
<p>'locked open and decentralized' -- what does</p>
<p>28:00</p>
<p>focus on pragmatic</p>
<p>planning the transition'</p>
<p>need a shock to the system</p>
<p>involve a fund to acquire companies, IP, relicense as commons</p>
<p>agritech venture capital fund that acquires and opens</p>
<p>impact investors should be interested b/c of:</p>
<ul>
<li>ROI feasible</li>
<li>SDG</li>
<li>nutritional</li>
</ul>
<p>'pull this round together'</p>
<p>'haven't yet conceived of a way to put this together without pulling together this portfolio'</p>
<p>partners:</p>
<ul>
<li>p2p foundation</li>
<li>platform cooperativism</li>
<li>akasha foundation / ethereum</li>
<li>open food network</li>
</ul>
<p>seed funding so that we can outline strategy in greater detail
and can tell the story</p>
<p>33:00 -- people don't tend to be systems thinkers</p>
<p>(but goodness -- this is such limited systems thinking)</p>
<p>none of the team members have deep agriculture expertise</p>
<p>systems thinkers
ecologists
peer to peer experts
cooperative experts
blockchain experts</p>
<p>but no deep agriculture experts (?!?!?)</p>
<p>38:00 -- how can we keep open source sustainable ...</p>
