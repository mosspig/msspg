        <h1>Easy Filesharing with Beaker</h1>
        
    <p>The below guide is for quickly getting up and running sharing files using <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/install/">Beaker</a>, a browser that can connect on the p2p web, and runs on Mac / Windows / Linux.</p>
<h2>Step One: Creating an archive and sharing it</h2>
<p>When we first open Beaker (or even just a new tab within Beaker), there is a &quot;NEW+&quot; button on the bottom right of the page.  If you click on that, it allows you to create a new archive that can be shared on the p2p web using a &quot;dat://&quot; URL.</p>
<p>I'm showing that process in the below gif:</p>
<img src="/img/beaker_new_archive.gif" width=600>
<p>Because that gif moves by quickly, I'll just highlight the menu that pops up when you click on the &quot;NEW+&quot; button:</p>

<p>As you can see in the gif, if you choose &quot;Empy project&quot; (as I did), then you're given a new &quot;Untitled&quot; project.  You can then name the project, and start dragging files into the project.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  you can continue to add files to this archive.  It is simply a folder on your computer.  In some cases you may need to hit &quot;publish&quot; in order for the changes to be made visible to others on the p2p web (still learning that myself :)).</p>
<h2>Step Two:  Receiving an archive</h2>
<p>Once an archive has been created and shared as above, others can view the archive contexts (effectively, making a local copy, which they also can re-share on the p2p web) by simply typing in the &quot;dat://&quot; url into Beaker browser on their computer:</p>
<img src="/img/beaker_receive_archive.gif" width=600>
<p><strong>Note</strong>:  this step requires that the recipient was able to get a long &quot;dat://&quot; URL somehow.  It might be nice to set people up on p2p chat, like Cabal, first, so that they can then share these URLs easily with one another :)</p>
