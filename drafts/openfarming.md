what is the motivation for centralize / decentralize? it's power.
review The Dig on common wealth -- the language -- it's about power, agency, governance. 

decentralization is also: anti-monopoly

but it's the logic of capitalism to lead to monopoly

incentivizing work based on getting rewarded for what you've contributed is perhaps the fundamental flaw

'from each according to their ability, to each according to their need'

how do people do it in math? in physics? etc?

'open farming is not the mediator' -- but, they manage the protocol -- so ....

what's the motivation for open farming? 

interesting overlap: blockchain royalites and carbon credits ... 

is it better to engage and critique, or simply ignore and move on?

'puts a legal barrier on free riders'

18:00 

honeycomb: 

so: how do we track meaningful tweaks to design?  what counts as a difference, who gets royalties?

invocation of cooperatives 

this is all a fantasy around how the data is useful or not, even on its own terms
and who would pay
at what level

i.e. if the incentives are at all important, then the *amounts* that we're talking about -- how much profit people get out of these systems -- is important.  if we can never imagine the data paying enough to be meaningful, then it's a non-starter -- even within the logic of capitalism.

'if farmer attempts to cheat the system, information services are disconnected
without the services, farmer becomes less and less competitive

so -- algoritmic punishment for not following the rules

once thought:  isn't blockchain typically sneaking IP in the back door?  licensing *assumes* IP -- otherwise why a license?

25:00 -- quadrant ignores: most of human history, socialism, many many projects, tax-funded projects -- new deal 

27:00 -- 'agriculture is pretty well decentralized at the moment' -- ???

'locked open and decentralized' -- what does 

28:00

focus on pragmatic

planning the transition'

need a shock to the system

involve a fund to acquire companies, IP, relicense as commons

agritech venture capital fund that acquires and opens

impact investors should be interested b/c of:
- ROI feasible
- SDG
- nutritional

'pull this round together'

'haven't yet conceived of a way to put this together without pulling together this portfolio'

partners:
- p2p foundation
- platform cooperativism
- akasha foundation / ethereum
- open food network

seed funding so that we can outline strategy in greater detail
and can tell the story

33:00 -- people don't tend to be systems thinkers

(but goodness -- this is such limited systems thinking)

none of the team members have deep agriculture expertise

systems thinkers
ecologists
peer to peer experts
cooperative experts
blockchain experts

but no deep agriculture experts (?!?!?)

38:00 -- how can we keep open source sustainable ...
